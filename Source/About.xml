Unsure how to set them up efficiently your megabase AC system to save electricity?
Trying to create a deadly heat/cold trap and you need some maths?
Or maybe you just like stats and dwelving deeper in the game internal systems?

Then this mod is for you, it adds various fully dynamic and explained statistics to RimWorld various heat sources and management buildings:

- Heat pushers (Campfires / Passive coolers / Generators ...) and their modded derivatives now display how much they push in the room per second.
Now you know how hot they will go once they store at least 1 unit of heat.

- InPlace AC buildings (Heater), RoomExchange AC buildings (Cooler) and their modded derivatives now display their max and current amount of degree they can control in the room!
Their various efficiency systems are now exposed for you to optimize your AC setup!

- Geothermal power is now as useful as can be, you can now look how hot those can run and make use of their power to heat up your base safely!

If you play with "Save our ship 2", check out "Save our ship 2 - Heat Statistics" to optimize your ship critical AC system!
If you play with "Save our ship 2 - Extensions", this mods adds stats to the subzero cooler, the other mod cited above adds stats to the heatsinks.

The mod is under MIT licence aka. Do whatever you want with it! Credit is always appreciated though! :D
