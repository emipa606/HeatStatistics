This mod is currently unmaintained (I don't have time for modding anymore).

Unsure how to set them up efficiently your megabase AC system to save electricity?
Trying to create a deadly heat/cold trap and you need some maths?
Or maybe you just like stats and dwelving deeper in the game internal systems?

Then this mod is for you, it adds various fully dynamic and explained statistics to RimWorld various heat sources and management buildings:

- Heat pushers (Campfires / Passive coolers / Generators ...) and their modded derivatives now display how much they push in the room per second.

- InPlace AC buildings (Heater), RoomExchange AC buildings (Cooler) and their modded derivatives now display their max and current amount of degree they can control in the room!

- Geothermal power is now as useful as can be, you can now look how hot those can run and make use of their power to heat up your base safely!

This mod is be safe to be added / removed from saves.
This mod should not have any conflicts with other mods.
Incompatibility with a mod only means not every building have those dynamic stats.

 -  Geothermal generators can be in multiple rooms at once (it counts as a wall), hence the actual current output cannot be calculated, the geyser state is also private, further preventing dynamic output calculation. 
 -  Vents equalize temperature between rooms with different values for each room so same problem as the geothermal generator: there is no easily exposable / understandable way to display all those values at the moment. It would require a specialized visualization and I'm not nearly fluent enough in rimworld modding or c# to do this in the foreseable future yet.
 -  Temperature equalization is not in the scope of this mod (yet, see previous point), so insulation mods / vents and the likes currently won't have those dynamic stats (would be pretty cool though)
